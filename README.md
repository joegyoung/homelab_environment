# Homelab environment
Documentation of setup for Proxmox and homelab

**This is a work in progress**

My homelab environment consists of Proxmox Virual hosts, self hosted technitium dns vitural server, and a step-ca ACME server for SSL certicates. I also have a NFS server using ZFS.  I will go over my set and management.

## Proxmox Virtual host servers

Proxmox is a hardware virtualization software. It allows deployment and management of virtual machines and containers. It is based on a modified Debian LTS kernel.
(Intstallation)[proxmox-install]
